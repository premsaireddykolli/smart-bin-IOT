# ♻️ Smart Waste Segregation & Automation System (IoT Smart Bin)

An IoT-based **Smart Waste Segregation & Automation System** that automatically detects, classifies, and segregates waste into **wet and dry categories** using sensors and servo-based automation.  
This project promotes hygiene, reduces human interaction, and supports **smart city initiatives**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Smart Waste Bin uses **sensor fusion and automation** to enable touchless waste disposal.  
When a user approaches the bin, the lid opens automatically. The system then detects whether the waste is **wet or dry** and routes it to the appropriate compartment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate waste disposal using IoT sensors  
- Segregate waste into wet and dry categories  
- Reduce manual waste handling  
- Improve hygiene and environmental sustainability

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects user presence  
2. Lid opens automatically using a servo motor  
3. Waste is analyzed:
   - Moisture sensor → Wet waste  
   - IR sensor → Dry waste  
4. Servo motor directs waste to the correct bin  
5. LCD displays waste type and system status  
6. Buzzer alerts user during operation
