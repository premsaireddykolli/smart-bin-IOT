♻️ Smart Waste Segregation & Automation System (IoT Smart Bin)
📌 Project Overview
The Smart Waste Segregation & Automation System is an IoT-based intelligent dustbin designed to automatically detect, classify, and segregate waste into wet and dry categories. The system minimizes human contact, improves hygiene, and supports smart waste management initiatives for cleaner and sustainable environments.
This project integrates sensors, actuators, and microcontroller-based automation to provide a touchless, efficient, and user-friendly waste disposal solution.
🎯 Objectives
Automate waste disposal using sensor-based detection
Segregate waste into wet and dry categories
Reduce human involvement and improve hygiene
Promote smart city and environmental sustainability concepts

🧠 Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor detects a user approaching the bin
The lid opens automatically using a servo motor
The waste is analyzed:
Moisture sensor identifies wet waste
IR sensor identifies dry waste
A rotating servo plate directs the waste to the correct compartment
LCD displays the waste type and system status
Buzzer alerts the user during operation
